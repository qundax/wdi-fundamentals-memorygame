		<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

		<h2>Why Play?</h2>
		<p>This game is both a test of memory as well as concentration (hence the name!). Playing it will allow you to train your mind to focus better on tasks as well as keep your brain active.</p>
